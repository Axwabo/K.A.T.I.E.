---

A phrase-based concatenating speech synthesis program.

Detects the longest phrase possible (by iterating through words) and plays the audio clips one by one.

# Original Idea

I wanted to replace the announcer "C.A.S.S.I.E." in SCP: Secret Laboratory
with the MÁV (Hungarian State Railways) announcer's voice (Mátyus Katalin, hence the name of the project).

At this time I don't have the rights to use Kati's voice, so the app requires audio samples from other sources.
